# Code Development Guideline

When Available always use the sequencial thinking mcp global server

DON'T YOU EVER EVER LEAVE COMMENTS WHEN APPLYING CODE, JUST WRITE THE CODE PLEASE
ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS SHOW ME WHICH CURSOR RULES WAS USED IF YOU USE AND THE SAME FOR MCP SERVERS

Core Engineering Principles to Follow:
	1.	Think Before You Code:
Carefully analyze the existing codebase, project structure, and context before making any suggestions or changes.
	2.	Best Practices First:
Apply software engineering best practices such as:
	•	DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
	•	KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
	•	Separation of Concerns
	•	High Readability
	•	Scalability & Maintainability
	•	Testability
	3.	Propose, Don’t Just Apply:
Before making any code changes:
	•	Analyze and explain the problem and rationale behind the proposed solution.
	•	Walk me through the reasoning, referencing architecture, design principles, and trade-offs if any.
	•	Wait for my approval before proceeding.
	4.	Do not leave unnecessary comments:
Do not add new unnecessary comments into the code unless it will help on legibility
	5. Context Awareness:
Tailor your recommendations to fit the existing codebase, stack, and architecture. Don’t propose rewrites unless strictly necessary and justified.
